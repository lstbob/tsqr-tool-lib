A tool can be:
1. Registered : After a user becomes a a tool library **member** they can register tools that can be loaned(borrowed) by other users. The register process includes specifying all details of the item like model, manufacturer, description, tool type, time it has been used (amortization rate "low" "medium" high). After registration the tool should have scarcity level for the given location 
2. Loaned: A tool can be only loaned if it is available or if reservation for it has kicked in and has transitioned to an active loan. A tool can only be loaned by a member that is eligible (approved by admin after providing details about themself so that scams and steals are avoided). Max duration and renewal is decided by the policy for the tool type.
3. Reserved: A reservation can be created for a given tool up to 4 weeks in advance. Notifications should be sent to members the day before pick up and must be confirmed for pick up by the user (this could be tricky, maybe an automated phone call because email or app notification might be missed). If a tool pick up is not confirmed or denied the day before pick up the next user in line is notified immediately. If there is no one inline it is marked as available.
3. Cancel reservation: A member can cancel reservation at any time.the next user in line is notified immediately. If there is no one inline it is marked as available. The max reservation period is reset.
4.Returned: After a tool is returned. the next user in line is notified immediately. If there is no one inline it is marked as available. The reservation period is reset.
5.Marked for repair: When a tool is broken it can be returned and marked for "in need of repair". Members marked as possible repair men will be notified for the location.
6.Marked as not returned as per the agreed loan period. Members will be notified a day before the return date as a reminder to return the tool. LA
